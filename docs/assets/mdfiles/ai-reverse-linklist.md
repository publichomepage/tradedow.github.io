To reverse a linked list in Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n\ndef reverse_list(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\nFollow-up question: How would you handle the case if the linked list is empty?
